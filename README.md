JavaFX Assignment: Jeopardy-Style Word Guessing Game


I chose to style the program based on the Jeopardy colours, with the dark blue background of the Jeopardy
question cards (and a similar font) as well as a logo at the bottom that says JAVPARDY! (like Jeopardy but Java).

I struggled with the GameController as the logic, as before this assignment I never created a program that included 
an API, so figuring out how to connect everything and handle the data was definitely a learning curve.
